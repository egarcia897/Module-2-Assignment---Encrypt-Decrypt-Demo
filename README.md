# Module-2-Assignment---Encrypt-Decrypt-Demo
Build simple application with user login and role-based access control. Demonstration of implementation of basic authentication and access restrictions based on role.  Python language to encrypt/decrypt a short message using symmetric and asymmetric method.

This program demonstrates symmetric (AES) and asymmetric (RSA) encryption.
User: 
  Mr.Emily (password: admin245), has full access to both encryption types.
  Andrew (password: user245), has access to symmetric encryption only
Shows keys, inputs, outputs, and strengths/weaknesses of eachh method.
Requirements: pip install cryptography
